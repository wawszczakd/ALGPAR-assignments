# ALGPAR Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the course
"Parameterized Algorithms".

## Overview

The course introduces methods for solving NP-hard problems in Fixed-Parameter
Tractable (FPT) time. It covers fundamental techniques such as branching,
kernelization, color coding, treewidth, and more. There were three assignments
in total, each consisting of four theoretical problems. Problem statements and
solutions are in English and provided as PDFs generated with LaTeX.

## Assignment Topics

The assignments cover the following topics:

1. Dynamic programming, branching, kernelization, iterative compression
2. Treewidth, color coding, algebraic techniques
3. W-hardness, important separators, representative sets, SETH and ETH

The solutions can be found in the respective directories. Unfortunately, I did
not manage to solve the fourth problem from the second assignment.
